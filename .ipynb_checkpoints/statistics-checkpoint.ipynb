In summary, the exploratory data analysis process involved: Basic descriptive statistics for the features with continous variables was taken. A Scatter plot was used to examine the strength and direction of the correlation between the each feature as a potential independent variable and the pearson correlation and p.value was taken to validate the results of visualing inspecting the scatter plots.\n",
