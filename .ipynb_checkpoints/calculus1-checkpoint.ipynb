    "Bassey is a octagenrian patient hospitalised at the King Faisal Hospital Kigali. Bassey suffers from Alzheimer's deisease - chronic neurodegenerative disease that usually starts slowly and gradually worsens over time(Wikipedia, 2020). Alzheimer's disease is the cause of 60–70% of cases of dementia. Bassey is selected for a trial of the newly developed experimental drug – imalyloidine. Previous trials of imalyloidine on monkeys with a variety of treatment regimen has shown a 70–90% rate of success in stoping and completely reversing the symptoms of late stage Alzheimer's disease. Imalyloidine has been cleared for clinical trials on humans and doctors are now tasked with finding the right treatment regimen to ensure imalyloidine works effectively.    \n",

    "<h3 style='text-align:center'>Problem Statement and Breakdown</h3>\n",
    "Supposed Bassey is progressively given doses of imalyloidine in a certain concentration of $C$ in a time interval of $T$. As a result of the repeated dosage of imalyloidine, the concentration of imalyloidine in Bassey's body builds up to a saturation level of $S$. We need to find the relationship between $C$, $T$ and, $S$ to help us determine the ideal time interval, concentration of the dosage of imalyloidine to be given to Bassey in other for imalyloidine to work effectively within the clinical constraints.  \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this process, doctors need to give Bassey a definitive prescription. For example: \"take 2 tablets $300mg$ of imalyloidine 3 times a day after food\". This prescription should be based on the desirable levels of drug concentration over time and known levels of saturation at which imalyloidine works effectively, metabolism and excretion of the drug in the body."
