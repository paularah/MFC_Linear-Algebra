    "    Its May 30th 1905. The world is currrently on lockdown becuase of Corona Virus; a deadly virus that has to put a huge percentage of socio-economic activies in most countries of the world on a hold. Dumebi Chemicals, an agro-chemical comapany is currently diversifying its product line, trying to a come up with the ideal disinfectant to protect offices, schools and other enclosed spaces. With the world looking for a way to restart socio-economic activities in full despite the continued increase of infection rate of the virus, Dumebi chemicals realises that providing a way to make enclosed spaces infection free would most definitely be a commercial success. Wensaslaus, an ALU student currently studying Computer Science works as an intern for Dumebi Chemicals. Wensaslaus is tasked daily with the job of balancing a number of complex chemical equations for all the possible combinations of chemicals the lab is experimenting with. Wensaslaus, majors in Computer Science and hasn't touched chemistry since his high school. On carefully evaluating the job he is tasked with, wearing the computer science student hat, he realises there's a more efficient way to tackle the problem.</p>\n"

    "<p>Balancing of chemical equation is one first few topics students are taught in chemistry. Students like wenseslaus are often taught taught to rely on intelligent guesses and heuristics to balance chemical equations. This method is called the inspection method. Inspection method works for small and relatively easy chemical equations but as they get complex, relying on guesswork to derive the right coefficients to balance a chemical equation can be inefficient and pain staking. As a computer science student, Wenseslaus is on the search for a more algorithimic way to balance chemical equations considering he has to balance lots of complex chemical equations on a daily basis. The balancing of chemical equations can be made much easier, especially for those who find it difficult, by moving the procedures toward the algorithmic and away from the heuristic. That is, a “step to step” procedure is simpler to master than is the haphazard hopping of inspection, even a highly refined inspection (Hutchings et al.,\n",

    "    A chemical equation is an expression representating of a chemical reaction. The reactants are placed on the left hand side and the products on the right hand side. An arrow indicating if a reaction is reversible or irriversible seperates on the reactants from the products. In the case of a reversible reaction there's one arrow pointing to the right and in the case of an irriversible reaction there is another arrow pointing in the opposite direction indicating that the chemical reaction can go both ways. Each substance taking part in the chemical reaction represented by its molecular formula. A chemical equation is said to be balanced if the number of atoms in each component of the reactants and products are the same.   \n",
